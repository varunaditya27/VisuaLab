# VisuaLab: A Modern Media Platform

VisuaLab is a modern, extensible media platform designed for performance, scalability, and a rich user experience. Built with Next.js, Cloudflare R2, and Supabase, it provides a robust solution for managing and sharing digital assets.

This project was inspired by the goal of re-engineering a classic PHP image gallery into a modern web application, bringing features like a responsive UI, pluggable architecture, and advanced content management to a new generation of users. The original legacy project can be found [here](https://github.com/halojoy/PHP-ImageGallery).

## Features

*   **Responsive & Accessible UI**: A clean and modern interface that works on all devices.
*   **Universal Upload & Display**: Supports common image formats with batch uploading and automatic thumbnail generation.
*   **Advanced Content Management**: Organize assets with albums, tags, and detailed metadata.
*   **Robust User & Rights Management**: Three user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with a clear permissions model.
*   **Powerful Search**: Keyword search on titles, captions, and metadata.
*   **Extensible Bonus Modules**:
    *   **In-App AI Image Generation**: Create images from text prompts directly within the gallery.
    *   **Custom Color Palettes**: A full theme editor with live previews to customize the look and feel.
